It has around 6.5 digits of precision and second-hand units can be acquired
relatively cheap. Availability of manuals and schematics, combined with absence
of *unobtanium* components, makes the device repairable and moddable -
basically, everything that a hobbyist needs.

This project aims at gathering available documentation & know-how of the device
as well as makes attempt at reverse-engineering some parts of it which are not
officially documented - firmware, ADC serial protocol, embedded factory test
programs, etc.
